# RLStudio NOTICE

This repository is an internal / private educational and experimental project.

No open‑source license is granted. All rights reserved. You may view and use the code only within the context explicitly permitted by the repository owner. Redistribution, publication, sublicensing, or integration into production systems is **not** permitted without written consent.

## Purpose
- Prototype reinforcement learning architecture ideas
- Demonstrate testing, reproducibility, and modular design patterns
- Serve as a learning sandbox (APIs, tooling, CI practices)

## Restrictions
- Not production‑hardened; no stability, security, or performance guarantees
- Do not distribute compiled artifacts, model checkpoints, or derivative works externally
- External contributions (if any are accepted) are treated as assigned to the repository owner unless separately negotiated

## Third‑Party Code & Dependencies
Any third‑party libraries, snippets, or tools referenced retain their original licenses and copyrights. Comply with each dependency’s license when installing or experimenting locally.

## Data & Models
No bundled datasets or pre‑trained models are licensed for redistribution here. Use only openly available benchmark environments (e.g., Gymnasium) under their respective terms.

## Future Licensing
A formal open‑source license may be added later. Until then, assume all rights reserved.

If you have questions about permitted internal use, contact the repository owner.
