# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing!

## Ground Rules

* All changes via Pull Request against `develop`.
* Ensure tests & lint pass locally.
* Keep PRs focused and atomic.

## Workflow

1. Fork & clone
2. Create feature branch (feature/ISSUEID-short-desc)
3. Implement + add tests
4. Update docs / changelog
5. Submit PR referencing issue

## Commit Messages

Follow Conventional Commits where possible (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:, perf:, refactor:).

## Testing

Use pytest. Add learning regression tests for algorithm changes.

## Code Style

Ruff (format + lint + import sorting). Type checking via mypy (strict for core modules).

## Reporting Issues

Use the bug report / feature request templates with reproduction steps and environment details.
